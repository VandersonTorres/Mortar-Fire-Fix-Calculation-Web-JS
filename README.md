# Mortar-Fire-Fix-Calculation-Web-JS

This application works to automatically fix mortar grenade launches that suffered any variation, both in direction and range. With an expertise acquired in my last occupation in brazilian army in a command position, i felt this need on the battlefield, and I was able to initialize this prototype.

The result generates a series of actions to be performed by the shooting team.
